								<h3>Story Time</h3>
								<p>Patio Kitchen & Bar was born from a simple dream shared by two longtime friends: to create a place where great food, cold drinks, and good company come together in a beautiful setting. After living in Vietnam for many years and falling in love with the culture, the people, and the vibrant energy of Da Nang, they knew they had found the perfect place to bring their vision to life.</p>

								<p>Set just off the busy main street, Patio blends the casual charm of a neighborhood hangout with a touch of upscale comfort. With open-air patio seating that spills onto the quiet sidewalk, it's the perfect spot to soak in the city’s energy while enjoying standout dishes made with passion and care. The kitchen is truly the heart of Patio, but a full bar with cold beer and craft drinks means there’s always something to sip while you relax.</p>

								<p>From the moment you walk in, you're welcomed like an old friend. Whether you're grabbing a drink, settling in for a full meal, or just watching the world go by, Patio is a place where you can unwind, connect, and feel right at home — from late afternoon into the night.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Community Involvement</h4>
								<p>The community plays a big role at Patio and we try to incorporate as many activities and activism as we can. We often organize fun events thorught the month and support local charities.</p>

								<p>One of our favorite practices and something that we are incredibly stoked about is our partnership with The Cat Butler, a non-profit group that advocates for and improves the living standards of stray cats. We even have a drink on the menu called "The Cat Butler" which is always changing with the season. Even better is that 100% of all profits from that drink are donated directly to the group to promote the health and wellbeing of the cats.</p>

								<p>Does all this sound interesting? Well, come on then, what are you waiting for? Come and join us in our fun, and maybe learn something about spirits while you are indulging.</p>
